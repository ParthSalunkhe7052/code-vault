## 🎯 What We're Building

Transform CodeVault from a Python-only tool into a **full Software Monetization Platform** that supports both Python AND Node.js.

### Why This Matters
- **Current market**: ~50,000 Python developers
- **New market with Node.js**: ~500,000 developers (10x bigger!)
- **Revenue potential**: From $10-30K/year → $100K+/year

## 📅 4-Month Roadmap (Simple Version)

### Month 1: Make Money 💰
**What**: Add Stripe payments so users can buy licenses automatically

**Features**:
- Pricing page (Free, Pro $20/mo, Enterprise $50/mo)
- Checkout page (Stripe integration)
- Auto-generate licenses when someone pays
- Fix branding (decide on "CodeVault" name)

**Why It's Important**: Can't make money without payments!

**Result**: You can start earning revenue immediately

### Month 2: Add Node.js Support 🚀
**What**: Let developers protect Node.js code (not just Python)

**Why Node.js**:
- Node.js is the #1 most-used backend language
- 10x more developers than Python
- Used for: Electron apps (Discord, VS Code), CLI tools, backend servers

**How It Works**:
- Use free tools: `javascript-obfuscator` + `pkg`
- Same license system (works for both languages)
- Users choose "Python" or "Node.js" when creating project

**Result**: 10x bigger market, way more customers
